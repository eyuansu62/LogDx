# CILogBench diagnosis report — `holdout` / `debugger-v1-mock`

Prompt SHA256 (first 12): `ecffdf03c99a…`
Cases in split: **5**
Methods evaluated: **7** (`raw`, `tail`, `grep`, `rtk-read`, `rtk-log`, `rtk-err-cat`, `llm-summary-v1-mock`)

This report scores whether a **fixed diagnoser** can identify the CI failure root cause given each context method's output. It does NOT evaluate the context methods on their own; that lives in the signal-recall report.

## Main metrics (macro-averaged per context method)

| Context Method | Success | Category Acc | Critical Mention | Must Mention | File Recall | Test Recall | Forbidden | Conf Err | Context Tok | Diagnosis Tok | score_v1 (exp) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

| llm-summary-v1-mock | 100.0% | 20.0% | 14.0% | 8.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 362 | 121 | 0.128 |

Columns:

- **Success**: fraction of cases where a non-empty diagnosis was produced (no provider error).
- **Category Acc**: exact match between `diagnosis.root_cause_category` and `ground_truth.root_cause.category`. `unknown` never counts as correct unless ground truth is also `unknown`.
- **Critical Mention**: fraction of ground-truth `required_signals` with `importance=critical` whose value/alias/file appears in the diagnosis text.
- **Must Mention**: fraction of `expected_diagnosis.must_mention` substrings present.
- **Forbidden**: fraction of cases where at least one `expected_diagnosis.must_not_claim` substring leaked into the diagnosis.
- **Conf Err**: cases where `confidence >= 0.70` but category was wrong or a forbidden claim appeared.
- **score_v1**: experimental composite; see `docs/evaluation/diagnosis_eval_v1.md`.

## Interpretation guardrails

- Mock diagnoser results validate the pipeline, not real LLM quality. If `diagnoser` is `debugger-v1-mock`, the numbers are shaped by simple pattern rules; they should not be read as an endorsement of any context method.
- Deterministic diagnosis scoring is a proxy, not a full semantic judge. A method can lose this proxy while producing a diagnosis a human would accept, and vice versa.
- Raw context is not guaranteed to win with a weak diagnoser: the diagnoser may drown in irrelevant lines.
- High signal recall does not necessarily imply high diagnosis accuracy. The context method may preserve evidence in a form the diagnoser ignores.
- Low context token count is only useful if diagnosis quality remains acceptable. A 99% reduction that forces abstention is not a win.
- `score_v1` is experimental. The individual metrics are what this report is about.
